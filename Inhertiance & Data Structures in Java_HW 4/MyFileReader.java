	 * Example:
	 * - Calling getCleanContent() will open and read the file, clean up the text line by line,
	 * add each line containing text to an ArrayList<String>, and return the ArrayList<String> from the method.
	 *   If there is a line "nice to meet you     ", it will become "nice to meet you"
	 *   If there is a line "    hello world    ", it will become "hello world"
	 *   If there is a line "today is a nice day", it will remain "today is a nice day"
