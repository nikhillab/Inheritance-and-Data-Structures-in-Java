	 * refuel(100), the gasRemained would be 100 - Then, if you call refuel(101),

	 * For the car, first check the amount of remaining gas in the tank. If it's
	 * smaller than or equal to 0, print "Gas out! Please add fuel!" Otherwise, you
	 * need to calculate the gas consumed during this run. Take the given number of
	 * hours that the car is going to run and multiply by the gas consumed per hour.
	 * Then subtract from the gas remaining in the tank. If the gas remaining in the
	 * tank is smaller than or equal to 0 for this run, print "Oops, gas out! Please
	 * add fuel!" and set the gas remaining to be 0.
	 * 
	 * Example(s): - For a car ("Benz" purchased in 2020): - If you call run(10),
	 * the gasRemained would be 0 - Then if you call refuel(100), followed by
	 * run(5), the gasRemained would be 50 - Finally, if you call run(5), the
	 * gasRemained would be 0
	 * 
	 * - For a car ("Jeep" purchased in 2019): - If you call refuel(200), followed
	 * by run(10), the gasRemained would be 100 - Then if you call run(15), the
	 * gasRemained would still be 0
